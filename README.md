This project exemplifies the MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel Coordinator) architectural pattern while showcasing robust SSL Pinning implementation using Alamofire. The codebase attains a commendable code coverage of 35%, underscoring the project's commitment to thorough testing.

The core of the application encompasses two main screens: the Currency Converter screen and the IBAN Validator screen. These screens are complemented by secondary screens, which include the Currency Picker and Home Screen. This shows hierarchy facilitates seamless navigation between the primary components.

Overall, our project combines smart design, strong security, and careful testing to create a great app experience.
